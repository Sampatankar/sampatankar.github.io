  <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
  <p>
    I have an eclectic and wide range of interests.  If I am not working or studying, I like to organise trips out to the countryside that incorporate a good drive, a satisfying hike, and a delicious meal.  I listen to the radio often, with Radio 6 Music and Radio 4 being particular favourites.  I thoroughly enjoy cooking, photography and all things technology related.
